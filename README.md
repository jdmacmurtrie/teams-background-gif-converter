# GIF converter
Microsoft Teams doesn't accept GIF files to be used as backgrounds, but it DOES accept animated PNGs.
This script makes the conversion and the transfer to the appropriate folder easy.

You'll have to add in your own file paths, but then it should be as easy as: 
```
$ python convert_gif.py
```

This conversion method is taken from [this article](https://rogierdijkman.medium.com/microsoft-teams-animated-backgrounds-b457ee38d50d).
